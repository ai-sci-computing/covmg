/// \brief Pure-gauge Wilson-action Monte Carlo sampler on the periodic 3D
/// `SunLattice` -- the "hard middle" between the paper's two easy extremes
/// (smooth fields with flux -> 0, and i.i.d. hot links): Monte-Carlo-sampled
/// configurations at finite coupling are ROUGH but CORRELATED, which is the
/// regime worth probing.
///
/// Action (SU(d), d in {2,3}):  S = -(beta/d) * sum_p Re tr U_p,  where the sum
/// runs over all unoriented plaquettes of the periodic n^3 lattice (3 per site).
/// With this normalization the leading strong-coupling prediction for the
/// average plaquette  P = <(1/d) Re tr U_p>  is  P ~ beta/18 for SU(3)
/// (= beta/(2 d^2)). The general formula does NOT hold at d = 2: SU(2)'s
/// pseudoreal fundamental doubles the leading term to P ~ beta/4. Only the
/// SU(3) slope is pinned by tests/test_mc_gauge.cpp.
///
/// Sampling: Cabibbo-Marinari sweep over the SU(2) subgroups (all (p,q) pairs),
/// each subgroup updated by the exact Kennedy-Pendleton SU(2) heatbath (with a
/// semicircle-rejection fallback at small effective coupling, where KP's
/// acceptance degrades). Each link sees the sum of its 4 staples in 3D (2
/// orthogonal planes x 2 orientations). Everything is deterministic in the
/// caller-provided std::mt19937_64.

/// One full heatbath sweep (all links, all SU(2) subgroups once) of the Wilson
/// action at inverse coupling \p beta. Requires a periodic lattice with
/// d in {2,3}. \throws std::invalid_argument otherwise.
