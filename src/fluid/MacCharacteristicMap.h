/// \brief Covector Fluids with a long-time characteristic mapping
/// (**CF+MCM**, Covector Fluids Algorithm 5) -- the paper's least-dissipative
/// variant, used for its hero trefoil (Fig. 9) and leapfrogging (Fig. 10) results.
///
/// Where the base method (\ref stepCovectorFluids, Alg. 1) re-advects the
/// velocity field every step -- accumulating one interpolation per step -- CF+MCM
/// maintains long-time flow maps and advects only **those**, reconstructing the
/// velocity from a snapshot \f$u_0\f$ via a *single* pullback. The paper: "this
/// largely reduces the amount of interpolation during subsequent advection
/// steps, by only needing to advect the map \f$\Psi\f$ and not the velocity
/// components." That is exactly the interpolation diffusion that otherwise smears
/// close vortex cores until they merge.
///
/// State carried between steps: the inverse (backward) flow map \f$\Psi:
/// M_t\to M_0\f$ and the forward map \f$\Phi: M_0\to M_t\f$ (both cell-centered
/// position fields, identity at the last reinitialization), plus the velocity
/// snapshot \f$u_0\f$. Each \ref step (Alg. 5):
///   0. estimate the frozen flow velocity at the midpoint
///      \f$v\leftarrow\mathcal P(\mathcal A^{covec}(u; u, \tfrac{\Delta t}2))\f$
///      (Alg. 5 line 3 -- the 2nd-order midpoint method; the paper ties this to
///      capturing leapfrogging, Fig. 7). The maps (lines 4, 6) are then advected
///      with this \f$v\f$. Disable via \p secondOrder=false to freeze \f$v=u\f$
///      (1st order, Alg. 1 style) -- kept only for A/B diagnostics.
///   1. advect \f$\Psi\f$ backward by the frozen flow (line 4);
///   2. \f$u_1 = d\Psi^\top(u_0\circ\Psi)\f$ -- one pullback of the snapshot (line 5);
///   3. march \f$\Phi\f$ forward (line 6);
///   4. \f$\tilde u_0 = d\Phi^\top(u_1\circ\Phi)\f$, error \f$e=\tilde u_0-u_0\f$,
///      correction \f$u = u_1 - d\Psi^\top(\tfrac12 e\circ\Psi)\f$ + minmax limiter
///      (lines 7-9, the BFECC treatment);
///   5. pressure projection (line 10);
///   6. reset \f$\Psi,\Phi\to\mathrm{id}\f$ and \f$u_0\to u\f$ (lines 11-13)
///      before the map accumulates too much error -- CF Sec 5.3 resets "either
///      after a certain number of frames OR when the map is no longer accurate
///      (i.e. \f$\Phi\circ\Psi\neq\Psi\circ\Phi\f$)". Both criteria are applied:
///      the frame count \p reinitEvery and the accuracy tolerance \p remapTol.
