/// \p dirichletCells are pinned to zero: their rows/columns are removed and a
/// unit diagonal is set, which makes the matrix strictly positive definite.

/// definite, every fluid connected component (through fluid-fluid faces) needs

/// It solves the **unpinned** homogeneous-Neumann system (the projection's

/// **warm-starts** the pressure field from the previous frame -- the pressure
/// changes slowly between frames, so the prior solution is a near-converged
/// start. Matrix-free, so there is no per-frame setup (unlike a cached AMG
/// hierarchy), and parallel. Being stateful (the warm start), \ref project is
/// non-const.
/// The pressure boundary condition is selectable: the default is
/// the closed no-penetration box (solved by the fast geometric multigrid); if
/// any wall of \p bc is open, the free-surface Dirichlet Poisson is assembled
/// and solved by a self-contained Jacobi-CG (no PETSc), so open runs stay as
